I like to focus in simple, readable and durable code.  Currently, I‚Äôm exploring Laravel/PHP world in the back-end as suggested by my senior colleague. The purpose is to learn about how does it handle huge and complex back-end structures. While in the front-end, I'm exploring SolidJs, which I really like how it works, uses JSX but doesn't has the downsides of React. For me, it seems to be the next React. When I‚Äôm not programming, I'm a husband, a good reader and a video game player (as every developer).",
